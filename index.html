                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div class='group'>
                    <div class='item-double'>
                        <p>After graduating college, I became a software engineer and I had been working on all kinds of
                            projects.
                            Mostly on the front end, database and network management side of things. I had joined a dry
                            cleaning
                            franchise in 2002 and then opened my own dry cleaning company in 2008, which I have been
                            working at to
                            this day. To support my business needs, I actively work on coding projects using all kinds
                            of
                            technologies. The custom software I created was very easy to use, feature rich and very
                            reliablbe, It
                            handling accounts for hundreds of my customers. I found software development very
                            interesting, rewarding
                            and challenging. Due to the pandemic, I found myself have much more time than before.
                            Therefore, I would
                            like to get my coding skill set more up to date and find a job besides what I am doing now.

                        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>,
                            I've learned a lot of techniques to become a much better software developer and I cannot
                            wait to apply
                            what I learn to the projects I will be working on.</p>


                        <p>In my spare time, I like to go hiking, biking, kayaking, fishing, watch Netflix and football.
